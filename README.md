# Automatic Dark Mode switcher for Old School Runescape Wiki

**Automatically switches Old School RuneScape (OSRS) Wiki dark mode according to user's browser/system theme preference.**

Enables the built-in dark mode by changing CSS classes on the page according to browser theme ("prefers-color-scheme").

To use, turn on dark mode on the Wiki from the menu on the top of the page, and the site will follow your browser's light/dark mode.

Additionally, you can enable and set a custom time frame in which the script will change to dark mode. E.g. you want to use the light theme on the Wiki while using dark mode in your browser during the day. See the script for comments how to set the time frame and enable it.

## How to Install
1. Install 
   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) /   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) /   [FireMonkey (Firefox only)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/)    or other userscript extension of your choice to your web browser.
2. Follow [this link](https://github.com/pirssi/osrswiki-auto-dark/raw/main/osrswiki-auto-dark.user.js) and your extension should automatically prompt you to install the script.
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

## General notes
The script was quickly scrambled together, and although I didn't seem to find any bigger problems, if you do come across any, feel free to hit me up through the GitHub issues page or any of the links found [here](https://pirss.in/). :)

Your extension should also automatically check for updates to the script (unless you have it disabled), in case any updates are pushed to the script on this repo page.
